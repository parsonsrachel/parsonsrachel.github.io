Hi, I’m Rachel Parsons, a current PhD student in computer science at the University of Maryland College Park. My research interests lie at the intersection of bioinformatic algorithms and machine learning. I’m particularly passionate about retrophylogenomics, and my work aims to provide tools that automate the use of transposable elements in evolutionary anaylses.

I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Engineering (BSE) in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Connecticut in 2019. Since then, I’ve been driven to deepen my understanding of high performance computing and machine learning, and I’m excited to use these new skills to address computational problems in biology.

Outside of my research, I’m passionate about teaching and community outreach. I also love collaborating with others, so please don’t hesitate to reach out if you’re interested in discussing research, sharing ideas, or simply connecting!
